    RNAtive addresses the problem of ranking RNA 3D models and recognizing the native-like structure in the set of
    tertiary models when the reference structure is unknown. It works on RNA structures having the same sequence. Up to
    100 structures are accepted at the input in one run of the system.

    RNAtive follows the multi-stage computation scheme. First, it retrieves the interaction network for every input RNA
    3D model. In this step, it applies selected functions adapted from RNApdbee. Next, it builds a consensus-driven
    secondary structure taking into account all the interaction networks and a predefined confidence threshold. In the
    third step, it computes INF (Interaction Network Fidelity) for every input RNA model compared to the consensus. It
    also evaluates the confidence of every base-pair in each input RNA model following the binary classification test.
    Finally, it constructs the INF-based ranking of all analyzed 3D models. RNAtive outputs the final ranking, base-pair
    confidence values and consensus secondary structure. The consensus is presented in multi-line dot-bracket notation
    and graphic format.
